# en_US

An expanded American English "`en_US`" Hunspell dictionary.

This dictionary is based on the [`en_US` dictionary maintained by Mozilla for Firefox](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/extensions/spellcheck/index.html) ([code](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/extensions/spellcheck/locales/en-US/hunspell/dictionary-sources)) and, by extension, the [SCOWL dataset](http://wordlist.aspell.net/). The dictionary is encoded in UTF-8 (as the SCOWL one has been since 2016).
